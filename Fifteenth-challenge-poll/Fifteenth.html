        Let's build a simple poll app!
        <br />
        <br />
        A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose,
        and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is
        stored in the starter object below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here are your tasks :
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The
        method does 2 things : 1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to
        input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like
        this :
        <pre>
          What is your favourite programming language ?
          0: javaScript
          1: Python
          2: Rust
          3: C++
          (Write option number)
        </pre>

        1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example,
        if the option is 3, increase the vlue AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1.
        Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes
        sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sensem right?) 2. Call this method
        whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button. 3.Create a method
        'displayResults' which displayes the poll results. The method takes a
        string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or
        'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results be the default
        option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13,
        2, 4, 1". 4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each
        'registerNewAnswer' method call.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hint : Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last
        section.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        BOUNS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the
        test data. Use both the 'array' and 'string' option. Do NOT put the
        arrays in the poll object! So what should the this keyword look like in
        the situations?
        <br />
        <br />
        BOUNS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3] BOUNS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]
        <br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <button
        class="btn btn-primary mb-5 pollAnswer"
        style="margin-left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%)"
      >
        Poll Answer
      </button>
    </div>

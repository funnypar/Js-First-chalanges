                There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
                other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!<br> 
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.
            <br> <br>
            2.Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
            and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
            as well (draw means they have the same average score).
            <br> <br>
            3.Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
            team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
            score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
            score, as well as multiple else-if blocks.
            <br> <br>
            4.Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
            both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
            points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

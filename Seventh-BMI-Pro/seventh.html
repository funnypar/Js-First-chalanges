        Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's
        use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height
        ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        1.For each of them, create an object with properties for their full
        name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith).
        <br />
        <br />
        2.Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the
        same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and
        also return it from the method.
        <br />
        <br />
        3.Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name
        and the respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than
        Mark's (23.9)!"

        Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and
        is 1.95 m tall.

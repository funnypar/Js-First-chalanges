        In this challenge you will build a function 'whereAmI' which renders a
        country ONLY based on GPS coordinates. For that, you will use a second
        API to geocode coordinates.
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Create a function 'whereAmI' which takes as inputs a (atitude value
        (lat) and a longitude value (lng)).(these are GPS coordinates, examples
        are below).
        <br />
        <br />
        3.Do 'reverse geocoding' of the pravided coordinates. Reverse geocoding
        means to convert coordinates to a meaningful location, like a city and
        country name. Use this API to do reverse geocoding:
        https://geocode.xyz/api. The AJAX call will be done to a URL with this
        format: https://geocode.xyz/52.508,13.3817geoit-json. Use the fetch API
        and promises to get the data. DO NOT use the getJSON function we
        created, that is cheating.
        <br />
        <br />
        3.Once you have the data, take a look at it in the console to see all
        the attributes that you recieved about the provided location. Then,
        using this data, log a message like this to the console: 'You are in
        Berlin, Germany'
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Chain a .catch method to the end of the promise chain and log errors
        to the console.
        <br />
        <br />
        5.This API allows you to make only 3 requests per second. If you reload
        fast, you will get this error with code 403. This is an error with the
        request. Remember, fetch() does NOT reject the promise in this case. So
        create an error to reject the promise yourself, with a meaningful error
        message.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Part 2
        <br />
        <br />
        6. Now it's time to use the recieved data to render a country, So take
        the relevant attribute from the geocoding API result, and plug it into
        the countries API that we have base using.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. Render the country and catch any errors, just like we have done in
        the last lecture (You can even copy this code, no need to type the same
        code)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        TEST DATA:
        <br />
        TEST coordinates 1: 52.588, 13.381 (latitude, longitude)
        <br />
        TEST coordinates 2: 19.037, 72.873
        <br />
        TEST coordinates 3: -33.933, 18.474
        <br />

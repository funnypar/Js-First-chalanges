        Build the image loading functionality that i just showed you on the
        screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tasks are not super-descriptive this line, so that you can figure out
        some stuff on your own. Pretend you're working on your own .
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Create a function 'createImage' which receives imgPath as an input.
        This function returns a promise which creates a new image(use
        document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the
        provided image path. when the image is done loading, append it to the
        DOM element with the 'images' class, and resolve this promise. The
        fulfilled value should be the image element itself. In case there is an
        error loading the image ('error' event), reject the promise.
        <br />
        <br />
        If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the
        solution.
        <br />

        <br />
        Part 2
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Comsume the promise using ,then and also add an error handler.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the
        wait function we created earlier.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display
        to 'none'), and load a second image (HINT: Use the image element
        returned by the createImage promise to hide the current image. You will
        need a global variable for that!).
        <br />
        <br />
        5.After the second image has indead, pause execution for 2 seconds
        again.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        TEST DATA:
        <br />
        test the error handler by passing a wrong image path. Set thenetwork
        speed to 'Fast 3G' in the dev tools Network tab, atherwise images load
        too fast.

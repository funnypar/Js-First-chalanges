Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

The idea of this challenge come from Jonas Schmedtmann courses in Udemy *****

But i did it by myself ;)

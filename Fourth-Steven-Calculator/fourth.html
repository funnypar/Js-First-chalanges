            Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
            restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
            300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.<br> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>    
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
        this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement üòÖ (If it's easier for you, you can
        start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
        operator!)
        <br> <br>
        2.Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
        (bill + tip). Example: ‚ÄúThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
        316.25‚Äù

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the
        console, along with the goal number (Example :"Goal 1: Lewandowski").
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We
        already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't
        remember).
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formated way, exactly
        like this :
        <pre>        Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33</pre>
        <pre>        Odd of draw: 3.25</pre>
        <pre>        Odd of victory Manchester United: 6.5</pre>
        Get the team names directory from the game object, don't hardcode them
        (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have
        the same property names.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <hr />
        BOUNS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
        players who scored as properies, and the number of goals as the value.
        In this game, it will look like this :
        <pre>
          <code>
            {
              Ronaldo: 4,
              Fred: 1,
              Fernandes: 1
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </div>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./Eleventh.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

            Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>    
        <br>
        <br>
        1.Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values.
        <br> <br>
        2.Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals').
        <br> <br>
        3.Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate
        tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for
        loop to perform the 10 calculations!

        Test Data :
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Data 1: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Bonus : Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as
        an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given
        array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to
        solve it:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition,
        start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the
        array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the
        'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values
        added together.
        <br> <br>
        2.To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the
        length of the array (because that's the number of elements).
        <br> <br>
        3.Call the function with the 'totals' array.

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is 
calculated (so one average score per team).A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

The idea of this project come from Jonas Schmedtmann courses in Udemy *****

But i did it by myself ;)

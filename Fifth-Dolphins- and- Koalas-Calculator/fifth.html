        Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is
        a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.<br />
        Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is
        calculated (so one average score per team).<br />
        A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the
        other team. Otherwise, no team wins!<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3
        scores
        <br />
        <br />
        2.Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
        <br />
        <br />
        3.Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each
        team as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the
        winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to
        the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
        <br />
        <br />
        4.Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1
        and Data 2.
        <br />
        <br />
        5.Ignore draws this time.

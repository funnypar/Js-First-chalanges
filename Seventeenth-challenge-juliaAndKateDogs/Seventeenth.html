        Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog
        owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one
        array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a
        dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years
        old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
        <br />
        <br />
        Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
        ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and LAST TWO dogs
        actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array,
        and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad
        practice to mutate function parameters)
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
        <br />
        <br />
        3.For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog
        number 2 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is
        still a puppy")
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Run the function for both test datasets
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
        <br />
        TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
        <br />
        <br />

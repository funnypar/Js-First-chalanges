        Let's continue with our football betting app!This time, we have a map
        with the log of the events that happend during the game. The values are
        the events themeselves, and the keys are the minutes in which each event
        happend (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time.)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happend
        (no duplicates)
        <br />
        <br />
        2. After the game has finished, it was found that the yellow card from
        minute 64 was unfair.So remove this event from the game events log.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Print the following string to the console : "An event happend, an
        average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that the game has 90 minutes)
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Loop over the events and log them in the console, marking whether
        it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) or the game, like
        this :
        <br />
        <pre>   [FIRST HALF] 17 : goallll</pre>
        <br />
        <br />

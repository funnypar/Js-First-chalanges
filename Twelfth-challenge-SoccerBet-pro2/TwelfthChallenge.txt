Let's continue with our football betting app!This time, we have a map with the log of the events that happend during the game.
The values are the events themeselves, and the keys are the minutes in which each event happend (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time.)

The idea of this challenge come from Jonas Schmedtmann in Udemy *****

But i did it by myself ;)
